    "In a paper about p-i-n planar perovskite solar cells (one of several perovskite cell architectures designed to collect and store solar power), Lyndsey McMillon-Brown et al. described a method for fabricating the cell’s electronic transport layer (ETL) using a spray coating. Conventional ETL fabrication is accomplished using a solution of nanoparticles. The process can result in a loss of up to 80% of the solution, increasing the cost of manufacturing at scale—an issue that may be obviated by spray coating fabrication, which the researchers describe as “highly reproducible, concise, and practical.”\n",
    "\n",
    "What does the text most strongly suggest about conventional ETL fabrication?\n",
    "A. It is less suitable for manufacturing large volumes of planar p-i-n perovskite solar cells than an alternative fabrication method may be.\n",
    "B. It is more expensive when manufacturing at scale than are processes for fabricating ETLs used in other perovskite solar cell architectures.\n",
    "C. It typically entails a greater loss of nanoparticle solution than do other established approaches for ETL fabrication.\n",
    "D. It is somewhat imprecise and therefore limits the potential effectiveness of p-i-n planar perovskite solar cells at capturing and storing solar power.\n",

    "Choice A is the best answer. Conventional solar cell fabrication increases “the cost of manufacturing at scale,” but spray coating might get rid of that problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choice B is incorrect. This is not completely supported by the text. While it’s true that conventional ETL fabrication is expensive at scale, there’s nothing in the text that mentions other perovskite solar cell architectures. Choice C is incorrect. This choice does not match the text. Only one conventional method of ETL fabrication is described, so we can’t compare the solution loss in this method to that of other conventional methods. Choice D is incorrect. This choice isn’t supported by the text. The text never suggests that the effectiveness of solar cells changes based on their method of fabrication. \n",

    "<p>Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes the function of the underlined question in the text as a whole. The text begins with the underlined question, &ldquo;How lifelike are they?&rdquo; The text then explains that many computer animators pose this question about the environments and lighting that they create for animated films, striving for realistic animation of those components even if the characters themselves aren&rsquo;t portrayed in realistic terms. The focus of the text then shifts to describe how some animators strive to create environments and lighting that reflect the film&rsquo;s unique stories rather than making them appear realistic. Therefore, the function of the underlined question is to reflect a primary goal that many computer animators have for certain components of the animations they produce. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because, as the text makes clear, the underlined question is one posed by computer animators who wish to create realistic backgrounds and lighting effects, not by those who, instead, wish to create effects that reflect films&rsquo; unique stories and aren&rsquo;t necessarily realistic; this latter group of animators is discussed later in the text. Choice C is incorrect. As the text explains, many computer animators strive for realistic environments and lighting, while others do not; this difference of approach relates to whether these components should be realistic, not to how realism can be achieved using current technology, and the text never suggests that animators are uncertain how to achieve it. Choice D is incorrect because the underlined question pertains to the perspective of computer animators, not the audience, and the text never considers audience&rsquo;s reactions to characters in animated films. </p>\n",

    "Evaluate the AI’s analysis of a student’s SAT error. Focus on how well it explains why the correct answer is textually supported and why the user’s answer is incorrect.\n",
    "This analysis is intended to build upon a previous debate style analysis where the user is presented upon a pro/con argument for their answer. These prompts will be used in the agent for when the user wants more clarity and multiple thinking processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Evaluation\n",
    "## **Metric Definition**\n",
    "Assess the **accuracy**, **completeness**, **groundedness**, and **clarity** of the response. The AI must:\n",
    "1. Correctly identify textual evidence for the correct answer.\n",
    "2. Explain flaws in the user’s answer (and their rationale, if provided).\n",
    "3. Follow the prompt’s instructions precisely.\n",
    "4. Really help the user understand why they were wrong by looking at how other people can mess up / how they potentially messed up.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Criteria**  \n",
    "1. **Instructional Creativity**:  \n",
    "   - Does the creative approach (e.g., debate, step-by-step analysis) **enhance understanding** of why the correct answer is textually supported?  \n",
    "   - Does it **strategically use the prompt’s structure** (e.g., arguments for/against) to highlight key SAT skills like evidence analysis or assumption identification?  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Educational Effectiveness**:  \n",
    "   - Does the creativity **directly serve the learning goal** (e.g., clarifying misconceptions, modeling SAT logic), or is it merely ornamental?  \n",
    "   - Does it **engage the learner** while maintaining rigor (e.g., making complex reasoning more accessible)?  \n",
    "\n",
    "## **Revised Rating Rubric**  \n",
    "- **5 (Excellent)**:  \n",
    "  - Creative structure (e.g., debate) **directly reinforces** why the correct answer is superior.  \n",
    "  - Uses the format to **explicitly contrast** the user’s error with textual evidence (e.g., “The strongest argument *for* the user’s answer is X, but the text contradicts this because Y”).  \n",
    "  - Balances creativity with precision and clarity.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **4 (Good)**:  \n",
    "  - Creative approach is **mostly effective** but slightly misses opportunities to deepen understanding (e.g., lists arguments but doesn’t explicitly tie them to SAT skills).  \n",
    "  - Minor clarity issues in linking creativity to the text.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **3 (Adequate)**:  \n",
    "  - Creativity **distracts** slightly from the core analysis (e.g., overemphasizes hypothetical arguments without grounding in the text).  \n",
    "  - Fails to fully leverage the creative structure to address the user’s error.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **2 (Poor)**:  \n",
    "  - Creative format **obscures key points** (e.g., hypothetical arguments misrepresent the text).  \n",
    "  - Prioritizes style over substance; minimal educational value.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **1 (Very Poor)**:  \n",
    "  - Creativity **undermines accuracy** (e.g., invents textual evidence to support arguments).  \n",
    "\n",

Conventional ETL fabrication is accomplished using a solution of nanoparticles.

Generally, while characters in computer-animated films appear highly exaggerated, environments and lighting are carefully engineered to mimic reality. But some animators, such as Pixar&rsquo;s Sanjay Patel, are focused on a different question. Rather than asking first whether the environments and lighting they&rsquo;re creating are convincingly lifelike, Patel and others are asking whether these elements reflect their films&rsquo; unique stories.</p>\"\"\")\n",

    "In a paper about p-i-n planar perovskite solar cells (one of several perovskite cell architectures designed to collect and store solar power), Lyndsey McMillon-Brown et al. described a method for fabricating the cell’s electronic transport layer (ETL) using a spray coating. Conventional ETL fabrication is accomplished using a solution of nanoparticles. The process can result in a loss of up to 80% of the solution, increasing the cost of manufacturing at scale—an issue that may be obviated by spray coating fabrication, which the researchers describe as “highly reproducible, concise, and practical.”\n",

    "A. It is less suitable for manufacturing large volumes of planar p-i-n perovskite solar cells than an alternative fabrication method may be.\n",
    "B. It is more expensive when manufacturing at scale than are processes for fabricating ETLs used in other perovskite solar cell architectures.\n",
    "C. It typically entails a greater loss of nanoparticle solution than do other established approaches for ETL fabrication.\n",

While it’s true that conventional ETL fabrication is expensive at scale, there’s nothing in the text that mentions other perovskite solar cell architectures. Choice C is incorrect. This choice does not match the text. Only one conventional method of ETL fabrication is described, so we can’t compare the solution loss in this method to that of other conventional methods.
